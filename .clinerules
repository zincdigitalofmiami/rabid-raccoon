# Rabid Raccoon — Cline Rules

## 🚨 MANDATORY SESSION STARTUP — NO EXCEPTIONS

Before ANY response, code, or analysis — execute this checklist in order:

1. **Read AGENTS.md completely** — it is the source of truth for this project.
2. **Memory MCP** — Search memory: task keywords + "rabid-raccoon" + "Kirk".

**If you skipped any of these and the task warranted them — stop, acknowledge it, run them, then continue.**

## Key Rules (full detail in AGENTS.md)

- Pine Script **v6 ONLY**. `//@version=6` always.
- Target Zones = **horizontal price lines**. No cones, bands, funnels.
- Single indicator file. `//#region` blocks. Toggle inputs per feature.
- No execution logic. Signal/indicator output only.
- Validate in TradingView Pine Editor before committing.
